# Introduction to GraphQL 📈 and Apollo Client 🚀 in React 

---

# What is GraphQL?

<div>
  <Appear>
    <p>GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data.</p>
    <p>GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools</p>
    <p>
      A server-side runtime for executing queries by using a type system you define for your data, and doesn't tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data
    </p>
  </Appear>
</div>
---
# Strong Types System 💪🏻
<div>
  <Appear>
    <p>By defining types and fields on those types, then providing functions for each field on each type</p>
    <p>GraphQL APIs are organized in terms of types and fields, not endpoints, so you can access the full capabilities of your data from a single endpoint</p>
    <p>Types to ensure Apps only ask for what’s possible and provide clear and helpful errors. Apps can use types to avoid writing manual parsing code.</p>
  </Appear>
</div>

``` graphql
type Query {
  me: User
}

type User {
  id: ID
  name: String
}
```

# You asked for it 📡

<Appear>
  <p>Each queries will always return the same exact data that you wish to receive, nothing more nothing less.</p>
  <p>GraphQL queries always return predictable results.</p>
  <p>Apps using GraphQL are fast and stable because they control the data they get, not the server.</p>

# Less request, less headache 💆🏻‍♂️

<Appear>
  <p>
    Typical REST APIs require your app to load multiple endpoints and requests to gather
    more than one resources.
  </p>
  <p>
    On GraphQL, queries can access not just the properties of one resource but also
    smoothly follow references between them, and you will be able to get all the data your
    app needs in a single request.
  </p>
  <p>Apps using GraphQL can be quick even on slow mobile network connections.</p>

    { lines: [28], notes: "And get it done" }
  ]}

# Arguments 🤦🏻‍♀️
<div>
  <Appear>
    <p>
      In a system like REST, you can only pass a single set of arguments - the query parameters and URL segments in your request
    </p>
    <p>
      Every field and nested object can get its own set of arguments, making GraphQL a complete replacement for making multiple API fetches
    </p>
    <p>
      You can even pass arguments into scalar fields, to implement data transformations once on the server, instead of on every client separately
    </p>
    <p>
      Arguments can be of many different types
    </p>
    <p>
      GraphQL comes with a default set of types, but a GraphQL server can also declare its own custom types, as long as they can be serialized into your transport format
    </p>
  </Appear>
</div>

### But how to query on same field with different arguments? 🤷🏿‍♂️

<CodeSurfer
  title="Aliases"
  notes=""
  code={require("!raw-loader!../components/Demo/Aliases.gql")}
  lang="graphql"
  showNumbers={false}
  dark={false}
  steps={[
    { lines: [2,5], notes: "We can now query for two hero, with different arguments" },
    { range: [11,18], notes: "Aliases will be used as the data field" },
  ]}
/>
---
Assuming we would want to display data of 2 heroes at the same time, side by side, where all of the query would likely be a repetitive fields 👩🏻‍🎤👨🏻‍🎤

<CodeSurfer
  title="Fragments"
  notes=" Fragments let you construct sets of fields, and then include them in queries where you need to"
  code={require("!raw-loader!../components/Demo/Fragments.gql")}

  showNumbers={false}
  dark={false}
  steps={[
    { lines: [2,5], notes: "" },
    { range: [10, 16], notes: "We can place those queries and fields into fragments" },
    { lines: [3, 6], notes: "Which we can use in the query" },
    { range: [20, 41], notes: "Which will return the two sets of data accordingly" },
    { range: [42, 60], notes: "Following their aliases" },
  ]}
/>
---
# Mutation ➕➖

<div>
  <Appear>
    <p>
      In REST, any request might end up causing some side-effects on the server, but by convention it's suggested that one doesn't use GET requests to modify data
    </p>
    <p>
      It's useful to establish a convention that any operations that cause writes should be sent explicitly via a mutation.
    </p>
  </Appear>
</div>

```notes
1. GraphQL is similar - technically any query could be implemented to cause a data write. However, it's useful to establish a convention that any operations that cause writes should be sent explicitly via a mutation.
2. Just like in queries, if the mutation field returns an object type, you can ask for nested fields. This can be useful for fetching the new state of an object after an update
```
---
<CodeSurfer
  title="Mutations"
  notes=" Submit a review of an episode"
  code={require("!raw-loader!../components/Demo/Mutations.gql")}
  lang="graphql"
  showNumbers={false}
  dark={false}
  steps={[
    { lines: [1], notes: "We create a mutation operation called CreateReviewForEpisode..." },
    { lines: [1], notes: "...which accept 2 variables, the episode and the review we are writing" },
    { lines: [2], notes: "This is mutation type, which will use the variables pass on by the operation" },
    { range: [3, 4], notes: "Notice that we include the field of the of the newly created review." }, 
    { range: [3, 4], notes: "This is useful when you're mutating into an existing data, so you can get the changes in one request" },
    { range: [9, 15], notes: "This is the variables we declared for the operation" },
    { range: [17, 24], notes: "Once the operation completed, it will return the field that we've asked for." },
  ]}
/>
---
# Multiple fields in mutations

<div>
  <Appear>
    <p>
      A mutation can contain multiple fields, just like a query with one distinction
    </p>
    <p>
      While query fields are executed in parallel, mutation fields run in series, one after the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      So when we sent 2 mutations in one request, the first is guaranteed to finish before the second begins, ensuring that we don't end up with a race condition with ourselves.
    </p>
  </Appear>

# Apollo 🚀

<div>
  <Appear>
    <p>
      Apollo is a family of technologies you can incrementally add to your stack: Apollo Client to connect data to your UI, Apollo Engine for infrastructure and tooling, and Apollo Server to translate your REST API and backends into a GraphQL schema.
    </p>
    <p>
      To put a universal API over your existing backend
    </p>
  </Appear>
</div>

```notes
1. Before we talk about Apollo React, we delves into Apollo itself
```

# Apollo Client

Allows you to bind your GraphQL data to your UI, with only the data that you want. It also add some extra add on and advanced data management, like pagination, subscriptions, prefetching, and more when you need them.

# GraphiQL

[http://localhost:4000/graphql](http://localhost:4000/graphql?)

# Writing the query

The easiest way to know what query to write is by writing the query in GraphiQL and copy and paste it in your app query.
